This is a non-TDD approach to Uncle Bob's bowling game kata.

It took about 2-3 hours including looking up some Kotlin stuff as I'm fairly new to it.

Note that I did intentionally have the main function only call roll with the same argument as in the kata. Some inefficiencies are introduced due to not tracking frames as rolls are made.

I intend to use this in comparisons of TDD to just blindly coding.
